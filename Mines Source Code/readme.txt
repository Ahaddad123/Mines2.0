mines lets you explore a mine.  The object of the game is to
visit all of the rooms and return all the treasures to the
entrance without making too many moves.  Specifying a
different mine number at the beginning of a game gives you
a different mine to explore.

Commands in the game are "N", "E", "S", "W", "U", and "D" to
move North, East, South, West, Up, or Down, respectively.  
Other commands are "C" to carry things, "I" to inventory 
what you are carrying, "L" to leave treasures, "P" to get 
the points you've scored, "O" for help getting out of the 
mine, "H" for help, and "Q" to quit.

In a mine, the passages are straight.  So, for example, if 
you go North to leave a room, you can go South to reenter 
it.  The rooms are not evenly spaced.  However, the distance
between adjacent rooms is always a multiple of the minimum 
distance between adjacent rooms.
